### Structure description

All of the actual page info is in two files: index.html and /images/juho työnhaku pakattu.jpg.

index.html consists of basic html elements such as head, header, main and footer. Main then is divided to sections: "About me", "Enquery form" and "Prices" sections.

About me: basic info about me and some professional skills.
Enquery form: Form to make enqueries about my services.
Prices: A small table with price info.
